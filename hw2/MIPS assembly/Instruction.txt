1. Bubble Sort - Original
  a. Create, build and run bubble sort program
    - Download the 2 files from sort-main.c and sort.S
    - Create those 2 files in QEMU/debian-mipsel virtual machine on Amazon Cloud. Please modify sort-main.c file to use your own name
    - Compile, assemble and link to create a.out executable 
      [hint] you can use shortcut, "gcc <file1> <file2> ...."
    - Make a copy of the executable file, "cp a.out sort-a.out"
    - Run "sort-a.out" and capture a screenshot
  b. Submission
    - Submit sort-a.out file and its running screenshot
2. Modified bubble sort
  a. Modify the sorting program to sort "char" array instead of "int" array
      [hint] in sort-main.c file, change all "int a[]" declarations to "char a[]"
    - Build a.out executable file
    - Make a copy of the executable file, "cp a.out sort-char-a.out"
    - Run "sort-char-a.out" program and capture a screenshot
  b. Submission
    - Submit modified sort-main.c and sort.S file 
    - Submit sort-char-a.out and its running screenshot
3. Summation of Integer Array (Bonus) 
  a. Download and create summation-main.c in QEMU/debian-mipsel virtual machine, summation-main.c
    - Modify to use your own name
  b. Create summation.S file that defines "int sum(int a[], int n)" function. 
    - This function will add up all elements in array a and return the result
  c. Build executable a.out file and make a copy
  d. Run summation-a.out and capture a screenshot
  e. Submission
    - Submit modified summation-main.c, summation.S and screenshot
